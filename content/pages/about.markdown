Title: About

I am Chaitanya Krishna Ande, currently working as a Post-doctoral Researcher at the Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands.

The broad aim of my work is to determine electrical, mechanical, optical and thermal properties of any material from a knowledge of its constitution and structure aloneâ€”with absolutely no experiments involved.
The conventional laboratory, in my case, is replaced by the computational laboratory.
In addition to understanding a given material, I aim to understand, explain and predicting transformations between different materials and their phases (chemical reactions, phase transformations, and so on).
Doing this requires a knowledge of materials science, physics, chemistry and computer programming.

At the moment, I am trying to understand the chemistry that happens at surfaces during the growth of a thin-film material using a deposition technique called Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD).
Thin-films are found in a number of technological applications like, computer chips, solar cells, batteries, sensors, and so on.
In fact, the entire semi-conductor industry is based upon thin-film technology.
Miniaturization of existing devices will increasingly rely on a better understanding and greater control of the thin-film deposition process.
The unique nature of the chemistry happening during ALD makes it possible to achieve the much required control over the thin-film deposition process.
