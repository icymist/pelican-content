Title: About

I am Chaitanya Krishna Ande.

I am currently a Post-doctoral Researcher at the Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands.

My primary interest is modeling and simulation as applied to materials chemistry and behavior.
I mostly use Density Functional Theory to determine materials properties without ever entering a chemistry lab.
