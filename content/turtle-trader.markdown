# Terminology
+ o, h, l, c :: open, high, low, close
+ x(n) :: where x is in [o, h, l, c], n=0 is today, -1 is yesterday, and so on.
+ TR :: True Range. It is max(abs(h(0)-l(0)), abs(h(0)-c(-1)), abs(l(0)-c(-1)))
+ ATR(n): Average True Range. Moving Average of TR over a period of time n.


# What should the portfolio constitute?
It does not matter what constitutes the portfolio.
It is important that they are as less correlated as possible.
Also, a combination of longs and shorts is better than all longs or all shorts.

# What percentage of the portfolio should be associated with each trade?
Not more than 2%.
Wrong calls on large trades will erode capital much faster than wrong calls on small trades.
2% on each trade gives a chance to have at least 50 trades.

# What are the entry and exit points for the trade?
Enter and exit during breakouts.

There are two strategies:
## S1
**Entry** :: Buy or sell short a market if it made a new twenty-day high or low.

**Exit** :: Sell or cover short if the market made a new ten-day low or high.

## S2
Longer-term trading strategy.

**Entry** ::  55-day breakout

**Exit** :: 20-day breakout

# When should you add to the trade?
